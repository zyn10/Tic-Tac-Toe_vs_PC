# Tic-Tac-Toe_vs_PC
1.** Introduction**
The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with C Language, use functions and array, and learn how to design a simple game with a friendly user interface using C Language.
2.** Instructions**
You can use nano or any other editor to write your C code.
  
3.** Steps:**
In this assignment, you will create a simple Tic Tac Toe game designed for one player (against the computer). You will need to create arrays and functions to complete this program.
1. The first screen should ask the user for his name, print a welcome message, and displays an empty 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board. Then, the program should ask the user to put the coordinates of his move.
Once the user enters the coordinates, the program should respond accordingly with a print of the user’s move and the computer’s move. This should go on until a winning pattern is found.
